        <h3> Hello! welcome to my page</h3>
        <p> 
            
            I am David, a goal driven mechanical engineer with high proficiency in computer programming, mechanical design, 
            manufacturing, and quality engineering. My years of experience in the engineering field made me a perfect 
            fit for a process engineering or manufacturing engineering role. I have academical knowledge as well 
            as practical industrial experiences in the application of Lean and Six Sigma, Design for Manufacturing (DFM), 
            Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing (GD&T). Others engineering concept such as mechanics of solids, strength of 
            material, heat transfer, thermodynamics, thermal control concepts as applied to system and component 
            cooling I have applied in the course of my practices. I have led series of projects leaning on my knowledge of
            project management, and my relational skills.
        </p>
        
        <p> I also have carried out series of app and software development project using  Python flask, Javascript, HTML, and 
            CSS. I am currently 
            undergoing series of other trainings to adequately develop my expertise in software development. 
            Details on my capabilities are highlighted in my <a href=".\resume.html">resume</a>.
